## Usage

Users must verify that they are over the age of 21 before using the site and create a username and password.

User's can filter through cocktail recipes by selecting their preferred alcohol type. Selecting a recipe will provide them with a list of ingredients and instructions on how to make each drink.

Users can also request for the app to select a cocktail at random for them. Just clicking the random drink button provides the user with a list of ingredients and instructions.

If the user decides that making their own drink is too much work, we have provided a few outlets for them to find a bar or brewery.

If the user clicks on the map on the homepage, they will be directed to google maps, where they can search for bars in their area. The user can also click on the brewery link in the navigation page. This will take them to a search page where they can enter a city and see a list of breweries for that area.
